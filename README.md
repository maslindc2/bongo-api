# Bongo API
This is a basic express sever used for fetching information from my CMS repository. Named after the Bongo Cat, this express server also serves as a widget on my Startpage. Fetches GitHub Raw links to assets like icons, bookmarks, search providers, and backgrounds. Bongo API serves these links at various endpoints. The Startpage then uses these endpoints to fetch information. This allows me to simply modify the CMS repo and any changes that I push to that repo will be reflected on the Startpage.
